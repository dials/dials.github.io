<h1>DPF3 Part 1: Correcting poor initial geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#dpf3-part-1-correcting-poor-initial-geometry" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following example uses a dataset kindly provided by Wolfram Tempel, which
was collected at beamline 19-ID at the APS. This dataset is available for
download from <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.45756"><img alt="DPF3" src="https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.45756.svg" /></a>.</p>
<p>This is a challenging dataset to process. There are a combination of problems,
including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A ‘reversed’ rotation axis</p></li>
<li><p>Incorrect beam centre recorded in the image headers</p></li>
<li><p>Split spots</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple lattices</p></li>
<li><p>Systematically weak spots that may correspond to pseudocentring</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these issues, the diffraction data is of reasonable quality and was
used to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=5I3L">solve the structure</a> after processing by XDS.</p>
<p>In the first part of this tutorial we will look at how to use the DIALS toolkit
to address the poor initial model for the experimental geometry, which leads to
problems with indexing. The first listed problem, namely the inverted rotation
axis, is trivially dealt with. However the incorrect beam centre is
particularly pernicious in this case. Rather than resulting in an outright
failure to process, we instead obtain an incorrect indexing solution. If we
were being careless, this could have lead to the integration of a useless
data set.</p>
<p>This tutorial is a cautionary tale, the moral of which is that the user should
employ the diagnostic tools at their disposal and to think about the output of
the programs they run.</p>
</section>
<section id="import">
<h2>Import<a class="headerlink" href="#import" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The dataset consists of a tar archive of bz2-compressed images. DIALS can read
the compressed images directly, however we need to extract the archive first:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>tar xvf DPF3_247398.tar
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At this point we have no reason not to trust the image headers. We shall just
go ahead and import the whole sequence as normal:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dials.import x247398/t1.0*.img.bz2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This produces the file <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">imported.expt</span></code>, containing an initial model for
the beamline geometry. You can inspect this model using <strong class="program">dials.show</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dials.show imported.expt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note how the goniometer rotation axis is given by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{-1,0,0}</span></code> rather than
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{1,0,0}</span></code>. This is because DIALS recognises that these images as being
from beamline 19-ID at the APS, which is known to have an inverted axis of
rotation compared with the more common direction. Settings such as inverse
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span>, or vertical goniometers, can be the cause of problems with
processing data from currently unrecognised beamlines. As an aside, in such
a case we could force the rotation axis to be whatever we want like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dials.import x247398/t1.0*.img.bz2 geometry.goniometer.axes=-1,0,0
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now that we have imported the data we should look at the images:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dials.image_viewer imported.expt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Keen-eyed observers may already suspect that the beam centre is not correct,
however we shall continue through spot-finding as this is not affected by
the experimental geometry.</p>
</section>
<section id="find-spots">
<h2>Find Spots<a class="headerlink" href="#find-spots" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Spot-finding in DIALS usually works well for Pilatus detectors, where
default assumptions about Poisson statistics of pixel counts, unity gain and
no point spread are accurate. These assumptions are not correct for CCD
detectors and this can be another source of problems with data processing.</p>
<p>To see the positions of strong pixels identified by the spot finding
algorithm, select the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">threshold</span></code> button at the bottom of the image
viewer’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Settings</span></code> window. In this case, the default settings are not too
bad: the strong pixels clearly follow the diffraction pattern. So, we will
run the <strong class="program">dials.find_spots</strong> program with default settings:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dials.find_spots imported.expt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After finding strong spots it is <em>always</em> worth viewing them using
<strong class="program">dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer imported.expt strong.refl
</pre></div>
</div>
<img alt="https://dials.github.io/images/correcting_poor_initial_geometry_tutorial/dpf3_bad_found_spot.png" src="https://dials.github.io/images/correcting_poor_initial_geometry_tutorial/dpf3_bad_found_spot.png" />
<p>Presented with this view, we might already start to worry that something is
not quite right. Instead of neat columns of points corresponding to a
regular reciprocal lattice grid, the points are aligned in curved or even
spiral tracks. Extreme cases of this may indicate something grossly wrong,
like an inverted <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> direction. In this instance the lattice is
still detectable, but distorted. We understand this as inaccurate mapping
from detector to reciprocal space. If the diffraction geometry model is
wrong, then <strong class="program">dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer</strong> cannot calculate the
reciprocal lattice position for each centroid properly. This can cause
problems with indexing because that requires exactly the same step of
mapping centroid positions from detector to reciprocal space.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these concerns, we press on into indexing.</p>
</section>
<section id="indexing">
<h2>Indexing<a class="headerlink" href="#indexing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dials.index imported.expt strong.refl
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It turns out that the reciprocal lattice positions were regular enough for
indexing to complete (‘succeed’ is the wrong word, as will become clear).
Remember that initial indexing uses fairly low resolution data only. At low
resolution the curved tracks of spots are straight enough to fit a lattice.
Macrocycles of refinement then extend the solution out to increasingly
high resolution. One might imagine this process as steps of unwarping the
distorted lattice from the centre outwards until a regular grid is formed.
Here’s some output from the end of the indexing log:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>RMSDs by experiment:

    Space group: P 1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is another point at which the experienced user may pause for thought.
Positional RMSDs of 0.98 and 1.66 pixels are rather bad. Good models for
synchrotron X-ray data
typically have values around 0.3 pixels or less. Split spots or other issues
with spot profiles may result in higher RMSDs for a solution that is still
correct, however we should always remain sceptical. Looking at the results
in <strong class="program">dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer</strong> is instructive as ever:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer indexed.expt indexed.refl

<p>Refinement has done what it could to produce a regular lattice, but it is still
messy. We also see that the majority of the centroids remain unindexed, and
these are messier still.</p>
<img alt="https://dials.github.io/images/correcting_poor_initial_geometry_tutorial/dpf3_bad_unindexed.png" src="https://dials.github.io/images/correcting_poor_initial_geometry_tutorial/dpf3_bad_unindexed.png" />
<p>At this point we should definitely heed the warnings and try to figure out
what happened and how to fix it. However, unfortunately a careless user could
go ahead and integrate with this model. Let’s see what happens if we try
to refine compatible Bravais lattices:</p>

</div>
<p>It turns out that quite a few lattices can be forced to fit the putative
indexing solution, but again there are warnings everywhere that imply none
of these are right. First look at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Metric</span> <span class="pre">fit</span></code> column. This value is
the <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1107/S0021889882011959">Le Page</a> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta\)</span>
value. For a correct indexing solution with a good dataset this should be a
small number, less than 0.1 say, such as in the
<a class="reference internal" href="processing_in_detail_betalactamase.html"><span class="doc">Processing in Detail</span></a> tutorial. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rmsd</span></code> column reports an
overall positional RMSD. Again, small numbers are better. Typically we would
look for a solution below a jump to higher values of RMSD. Here they are all
pretty bad, at around an order of magnitude larger than what we’d expect
from good data. Another clear indication that none of the symmetry operations
implied by the higher symmetry lattices is correct is given by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">min/max</span>
<span class="pre">cc</span></code> column. This reports the lowest and highest correlation coefficients
between the rough spot-finding intensities of subsets of reflections related
by symmetry elements of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lattice</span></code>. For a real solution without rather
extreme radiation damage or other scaling issues we would expect much larger
numbers than these, say &gt;0.5 or so for both the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">min</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max</span></code> values.</p>
</section>
<section id="check-indexing-symmetry">
<h2>Check indexing symmetry<a class="headerlink" href="#check-indexing-symmetry" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The fact that none of the correlation coefficients is high is a hint that
although the spots we indexed may indeed be real, perhaps the indices are
shifted by some value. This would be equivalent to the beam centre latching
onto some very low resolution Bragg reflection rather than the direct beam
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl = (0,0,0)\)</span>. DIALS offers a tool to check this. If we run:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dials.check_indexing_symmetry indexed.expt indexed.refl grid=1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>then all combinations of off-by-one offsets in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(l\)</span>
will be checked by testing correlation coefficients between sets of reflections
related by symmetry. Here the model crystal symmetry is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P 1\)</span>, so we are
testing only the Friedel pairs. The results are printed as a table in the
output:</p>

<h2>Discover a better experimental model<a class="headerlink" href="#discover-a-better-experimental-model" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have determined that there is a problem with indexing, which gives us a
mis-indexed solution. The typical culprit in such cases is a badly wrong
beam centre. DIALS provides the
<strong class="program">dials.search_beam_position</strong>, which can help out
here. This performs a search to improve the direct beam position using
the <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1107%2FS0021889804005874">methods</a> originally
implemented in <strong class="program">LABELIT</strong>.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In particularly bad cases it may useful to perform this search iteratively.
Indeed that is what we have done here by requesting two macrocyles. The first
macrocycle was not sufficient to find the real beam centre, but it improved
the search enough that it could be found in the second round:</p>

<p>We may now go on to refine the solution and integrate, following the steps
outlined in the <a class="reference internal" href="processing_in_detail_betalactamase.html"><span class="doc">Processing in Detail</span></a> tutorial. This is left
as an exercise for the reader. You can continue to solve
the structure in the primitive orthorhombic lattice, however model refinement
will present difficulties.</p>
<p>Could we have foreseen this difficulties as early as the indexing step in DIALS?
Can we circumvent them? These are the topics explored in the second part of this
tutorial at <a class="reference internal" href="centring_vs_pseudocentring.html"><span class="doc">DPF3 Part 2: A question of centring</span></a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusions<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusions" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Incorrect or wrongly-interpreted image headers are a fact of life. You will
encounter these.</p></li>
<li><p>When beam centre problems are suspected, try
<strong class="program">dials.search_beam_position</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong class="program">dials.reciprocal_lattice_viewer</strong> and
<strong class="program">dials.image_viewer</strong> are excellent troubleshooting tools for all
sorts of spot finding and indexing problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Some issues manifest as outright failures in indexing, others are more
insidious and may result in a misindexed solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Look out for CCs to detect misindexed data, and remember
<strong class="program">dials.check_indexing_symmetry</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Always use the diagnostic tools!</p></li>
